            <h3>MSN-06 SINANJU</h3>
            <p>The Sinanju is back again! The Ver.Ka release showed the Sinanju as it appeared in the manga, so of course it didn't have anime-accurate coloration and the massive bazooka, both of which have been faithfully reproduced for this release! Not only that, but new markings are included and the inner frame has been recast in PS plastic instead of ABS, so it's paint-friendly now! Also included are the shield, beam rifle, and beam axe with effect parts!</p>
